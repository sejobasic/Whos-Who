# Who's Who React Project

### This project was a React group assignment during my training at Cook Systems Fast Track Program.
For this assignment, we were tasked with developing a front-end React application that interfaces with [Spotify'sAPI](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) in order to get genre's, artists, and sample songs. The user will then be able to listen to songs and guess which artist created it. 

### Home Page
On the **Home** page, a client will select their game configuration from a series of dropdowns a genre, number of artists, and number of song samples.

### Game Page
For the **Game** page, depending on how the user configured their own game will be displayed with a series of artists cards from the specific genre they chose and a number of media players with sample songs. The media players were implemented using [HowlerJS](https://howlerjs.com/) for controlling playback, volume, and song skipping and styled with CSS. I used conditional rendering to visually signify a winner or loser apparent to the user using modals and a [React Confetti Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-confetti).

### Technologies Used
1. React/JavaScript
2. CSS
3. HowlerJS
4. Spotify API
